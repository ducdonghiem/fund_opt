# Harvest Problem

This repository contains solutions to the Harvest Problem, which involves optimizing the harvesting schedule for a set of agricultural fields to comply with both minimum and maximum processing capacity constraints at a processing plant, while minimizing the difference in the number of agricultural products harvested between days.
